# A KNN -done
_2 points_

- How many distances you need to calculate if you have 60,000 samples in the trainingset for 50 samples? 
- How many distances do you need to calculate if you have n samples im the trainingset?

# B KNN MNIST -done
_3 points_

- What is the error rate of KNN on the test set?
    - done
- What is the error rate for each label (number)?

Do for k = 2, 4, 8

- How does the choice of k influence the results?

# C K-means MNIST -i: done
_4 points_

- What is the majority class of each cluster? 
- What is the percentage of the majority class in each cluster? 
- Does each number have a cluster?
- If not, which hasn't?

Do this for 10, 100, 1000 iterations

# D MNIST understanding
_5 points_

Some numbers are more difficult to predict with KNN amd to cluster with K-means. 
Show why. Start with examples, and get more general

# E KNN and K-means CIFAR- done
_5 points_

transform cifar-10 to grayscale. 
    -done

- Does knn work similarly good?
    -done
- Does k-means work similarly good?
    -done
- Demonstrate this similar to  B, C-done and D

# F Linear regression BOSTON- done
_5 points_

Train a linear regression model on the BOSTON dataset to predict median values of houses. Test it on the test set.
Show the code how you did it! What dependent variables (columns) have the biggest influence?

# G Logistic regression MNIST -done
_4 points_

Evalute logistic regression as B  on MNIST

# H Feedback
_2 points_
